A smart Building Analysis Tool (BAT) designed for architects to enhance the accessibility & navigation of healthcare spaces for visually-impaired users.

Features: 

1.Graph-based spatial analysis: Spot potential navigation bottlenecks, identify wayfinding improvements.

2.Image segmentation of interiors: Highlight key elements (doors, ramps, tactile surfaces).'

3.RAG: Recommend accessible design strategies tailored to visually-impaired users.

Importance values excel: We included an Excel sheet that ranks different spaces within a healthcare facility based on their importance for visually impaired users. Each space was evaluated using a priority score from 1 to 10, where:

10 = most critical for independent and safe navigation

1 = least critical or non-essential for direct user access

This hierarchy was developed to guide our design and analysis tool in emphasizing high-priority zones like entrances, reception areas, restrooms, and examination rooms. Lower-priority zones (e.g., staff-only areas or storage) were treated with less accessibility emphasis in automated recommendations.
